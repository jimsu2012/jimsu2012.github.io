      <description>Most advice is repeated so often you don&amp;rsquo;t need to hear it again. For example, eat healthy and exercise. You&amp;rsquo;ve already heard this a hundred times; you don&amp;rsquo;t need to hear it again.
This doesn&amp;rsquo;t make the advice wrong. Eat healthy and exercise is correct. What you need, though, is to put it in action; hearing it again doesn&amp;rsquo;t do that.
Usually, the boring and obvious advice are the ones that matter most.</description>
