Most advice is repeated so often you don't need to hear it again. For example, eat healthy and exercise. You've already heard this a hundred times; you don't need to hear it again.

This doesn't make the advice wrong. Eat healthy and exercise is correct. What you need, though, is to put it in action; hearing it again doesn't do that.

Usually, the boring and obvious advice are the ones that matter most. They are also the ones that are the hardest to do. For example, start your homework early. Easy to say, difficult to do.

People seek advice in the hope that it will make hard things easy. But this doesn't work. If it did, everyone would know it already, and it wouldn't be considered advice anymore (it would be considered standard practice). The most general advice everyone already knows, and they are themselves hard.

Good advice is by definition useful. But the best advice are the ones you've already heard.
